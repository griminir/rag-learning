# RAG Technologies Inc. - Information Security Policy

**Document ID**: SEC-POL-001
**Version**: 3.2
**Effective Date**: January 1, 2024
**Review Date**: January 1, 2025
**Classification**: Internal

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This Information Security Policy establishes the framework for protecting RAG Technologies' information assets, systems, and data. It applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, temporary workers, and third parties who access company information or systems.

The policy covers all forms of information including electronic data, paper documents, verbal communications, and intellectual property. It applies regardless of where work is performed—in the office, at home, or while traveling.

## 2. Information Security Principles

RAG Technologies' security program is built on three fundamental principles:

### 2.1 Confidentiality
Information must be accessible only to those authorized to access it. We implement access controls, encryption, and other safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure.

### 2.2 Integrity
Information must be accurate and complete. We implement controls to prevent unauthorized modification and ensure data quality throughout its lifecycle.

### 2.3 Availability
Information must be accessible when needed by authorized users. We implement redundancy, backup, and disaster recovery measures to ensure business continuity.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

### 3.1 Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
The CISO is responsible for the overall security program, including policy development, risk management, incident response, and security awareness. The CISO reports directly to the CEO and provides quarterly updates to the Board of Directors.

**Current CISO**: Dr. Ingrid Larsen (ingrid.larsen@ragtechnologies.com)

### 3.2 Security Team
The Information Security team implements and operates security controls, monitors for threats, investigates incidents, and provides guidance to the organization. The team operates a 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC) in our Oslo headquarters.

### 3.3 IT Department
IT is responsible for implementing technical security controls, maintaining secure infrastructure, and supporting security initiatives. IT works closely with Security to ensure systems are configured according to security standards.

### 3.4 Department Managers
Managers are responsible for ensuring their teams comply with security policies, complete required training, and report security concerns. Managers must approve access requests for their team members.

### 3.5 All Employees
Every employee is responsible for protecting information assets, following security policies, completing security training, and reporting incidents and vulnerabilities.

## 4. Data Classification

All information must be classified according to its sensitivity. RAG Technologies uses four classification levels:

### 4.1 Public
Information intended for public disclosure. No access restrictions required.
- Published marketing materials
- Press releases
- Public website content
- Open source code contributions

### 4.2 Internal
Information for use within the company. Should not be shared externally without authorization.
- Internal communications
- Non-sensitive business documents
- General policies and procedures
- Internal project documentation

### 4.3 Confidential
Sensitive business information that could harm the company if disclosed. Access restricted to those with legitimate business need.
- Financial data and forecasts
- Strategic plans
- Customer lists and pricing
- Employee personal information
- Non-public product roadmaps

### 4.4 Restricted
Highly sensitive information requiring the strongest protections. Access strictly limited and monitored.
- Customer personal data (PII)
- Trade secrets and source code
- Security configurations and credentials
- Legal matters and investigations
- M&A activities

## 5. Access Control

### 5.1 Principle of Least Privilege
Users are granted only the minimum access necessary to perform their job functions. Access rights are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as roles change.

### 5.2 Identity and Access Management
All users must have a unique identity in our identity management system (Okta). Generic or shared accounts are prohibited except for specific approved use cases with compensating controls.

### 5.3 Authentication Requirements

**Standard Users**:
- Minimum 12-character password with complexity requirements

**Privileged Users** (system administrators, database administrators, etc.):
- Minimum 16-character password
- Hardware security key required (YubiKey)
- Password rotation every 30 days
- Privileged Access Management (PAM) system with session recording
- Just-in-time access for sensitive systems

### 5.4 Remote Access
Remote access to company systems requires:
- Company-managed device or approved BYOD device
- VPN connection using the GlobalProtect client
- Multi-factor authentication
- Compliance with endpoint security requirements

Public WiFi should be avoided. If necessary, use the VPN immediately upon connecting.

### 5.5 Third-Party Access
Third parties requiring access to company systems must:
