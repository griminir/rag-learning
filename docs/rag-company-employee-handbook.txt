# RAG Technologies Inc. - Employee Handbook

## Welcome to RAG Technologies

Welcome to RAG Technologies Inc., a leading innovator in artificial intelligence and knowledge management solutions. Founded in 2019 by Dr. Elena Vasquez and Marcus Chen in Oslo, Norway, our company has grown from a small startup to a global enterprise with over 2,500 employees across 12 countries.

Our mission is to democratize access to intelligent information retrieval systems, making AI-powered knowledge management accessible to organizations of all sizes. We believe that the future of work depends on seamlessly connecting people with the information they need, exactly when they need it.

## Company Values

### Innovation First
At RAG Technologies, we embrace a culture of continuous innovation. Every employee is encouraged to dedicate 10% of their working hours to experimental projects and research. Our Innovation Lab program has produced 47 patents and countless product improvements since its inception in 2020.

### Transparency and Trust
We operate on a foundation of radical transparency. All company financials, strategic decisions, and major initiatives are shared with employees through our monthly Town Hall meetings and the internal RAGnet portal. We trust our employees with information because we believe informed employees make better decisions.

### Sustainable Growth
Environmental responsibility is not just a checkbox for us—it's a core business principle. Our data centers run on 100% renewable energy, and we achieved carbon neutrality in 2023. Every employee receives an annual sustainability bonus based on the company's environmental performance metrics.

### Diversity and Inclusion
We actively cultivate a diverse workforce because different perspectives lead to better solutions. Our D&I council meets monthly and has implemented programs that have increased representation of underrepresented groups by 34% since 2021.
