This is a sample text file for demonstrating document loading and text chunking with LangChain.

The RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter will break this text into smaller chunks while maintaining some overlap between chunks to preserve context.

This helps when working with large documents that need to be processed by language models with token limits.
